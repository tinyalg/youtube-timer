## Description
A smart browser extension that tracks your viewing time on video streaming sites to help prevent binge-watching.
Ever realized you've spent the whole day watching videos?
This tool helps you regain control of your time by displaying your daily viewing duration right on your browser toolbar in real-time.

### Key Features

* **Real-time Badge Display:**
  Shows today's total viewing time on the icon (e.g., "45s", "59m", "1.5h").
  * **Active Mode (Red):** Lights up when you are watching a video.
  * **Inactive Mode (Gray):** Dims when you are not watching or the window is in the background.

* **Detailed Tooltip:**
  Hover over the icon to see the exact time down to the second (e.g., "Today: 1h 23m 45s").

* **Fully Customizable Sites:**
  By default, it supports YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video.
  You can add any other video site you want to track via the Preferences tab!

* **Smart Tracking:**
  Tracks time only when the video tab is active or audio is playing in the background.
  It automatically stops counting when:
  * The video is paused or no audio is playing.
  * Your PC goes to sleep.

* **History & CSV Export:**
  Click the icon to view your past viewing history in a popup.
  You can also download the data as a CSV file for your own analysis.

### Data & Privacy

This extension is designed with user privacy as the top priority.

* **Local Storage Only:** All viewing records are stored locally on your device.
* **No External Tracking:** No data is ever sent to external servers or analytics tools.
* **Permissions:** Uses only the minimum necessary permissions.
